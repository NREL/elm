The table "blk_annual_demand" has six columns: "load_scenario", "year", "block_fips", "tract_fips", "geography_id", and "kwh". The "load_scenario", "year", "block_fips", and "tract_fips" columns are of type "text", while the "geography_id" column is of type "character varying". The "kwh" column is of type "double precision". The table contains data on annual electricity demand (in kilowatt-hours) for different geographic areas, identified by their block and tract FIPS codes, under different load scenarios. The load scenarios represent varying levels of grid loading including moderate, high, and stress in ascending order. The years covered span from 2020 to 2045 in 5 year increments.
The table "lc_annual_demand_enduse" has nine columns: "load_scenario", "year", "geography_id", "scenario_year", "load_center", "sector", "enduse", "kwh", and "kwh_w_dlosses". It appears to be a database of annual electricity demand broken down by load scenario, year, geography, scenario year, load center, sector, end use, and two different measures of electricity consumption (kwh and kwh_w_dlosses).
The table "lc_annual_gas_demand" has seven columns: "load_scenario" (text), "year" (text), "geography_id" (bigint), "scenario_year" (text), "load_center" (bigint), "sector" (text), and "btu" (double precision). It appears to be a record of annual gas demand for different load scenarios, years, geographies, scenario years, load centers, and sectors. The "btu" column likely represents the amount of gas demanded in British Thermal Units.
